# Hello! I'm Corbin Christiansen üëã

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics. It includes projects, code samples, and insights I've gained along the way. This portfolio is a work in progress and I will be updating it regularly as I learn new skills and complete new projects.


As I continue my studies, I will continue to add more of my finding and insights from different projects I undertake in the statistics and data science field. You can expect to see projects involving data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis, NumPy for numerical computing, R for statistics
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and GGplot2; Rshiny for interactive dashboards
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data

## üìà My Projects

### [KNN Blog Project](blog.md)
Learn how to set up a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm in the context of classifing board game genres.
